This script defines a data type to represent the result of the [libSSR](https://github.com/tjsego/libSSR) tool.

The script then produces standards to represent and validate data of this type, in HDF5, JSON, XML, and YAML.

The generated standards (schemas), and data that can be validated against these schemas, are available in `output`.
